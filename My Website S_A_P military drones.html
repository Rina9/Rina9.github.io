<p>Military drones are very useful, meaning that they can be used to:</p>
<p>Spy on the enemy</p>
<p>Attack enemies</p> 
<p>Have much more stealth without a human operating it.</p>
<p> The pros to this are that they will collect information. Meaning data from the enemy that could
possibly be hard to get. Secondly it would be cost effective to have drones fight instead of risking the 
lives of a numerous amount of soldiers. Lastly drones can be much more quiet than humans which allows you to give
the enemy the element of surprise. </p>
<p>The cons to this are that the drones could be taken and used to find the location of where you are. They can also
be hacked and reprogrammed to attack you instead of the enemy.</p>
