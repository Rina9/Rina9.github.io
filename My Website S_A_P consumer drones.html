<p>These kinds of drones can be used to:</p>
<p>Survey the house at night</p>
<p>Walk the dog</p>
<p>Water the plants</p>
<p>The pros are that you'll have more free time and you'd be less stressed.</p>
<p>The cons are that  the drone could get out of control and lose the dog. Also it can over water the plants,
or not water them at all.</p>
