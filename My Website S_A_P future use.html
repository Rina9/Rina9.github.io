<h2>Opportunities for Drones in the Future</h2>
<p>Drones will make it easier for us human beings in the future. It can be used to deliver items such as:groceries,
fast food, beauty products,etc. They can also be used to create interesting views for movies or used to survey the 
community instead of having a neighbourhood watch. They could be used as speakers to advertise or broadcast news.</p>

<p>For everything good there is something bad. Meaning that not everyone will like the concept of having drones. Some 
may protest this rapid development in technology. Certain items needed to build particular drones might be in limited supply 
so the drones themselves might be sold at a higher price. Lastly, the drones can be a danger to animals,meaning they could
harm a bird with its blades. However it could be the case that the bird will attempt to destroy the drone.
