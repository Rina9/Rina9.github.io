<p>Drones are very useful for farmers in agriculture.Agricultural producers must embrace revolutionizing strategies for 
producing food, increasing productivity, and prioritizing sustainability. Drones are part of the answer, 
along with closer collaboration between the government, technology leaders, and industries. 
These aerial devices can be used:</p>

</center>
<p> There are cons to this, one of them being that it is not guaranteed that the drone will not get stolen. Secondly 
the drone could get destroyed by the livestock. Lastly the drone could lose the items it is programmed to pick up.</p>

<p> The pros to this are that you'll have more free time to do what you want. You will also save time from picking 
the crops.Drone technology will give the agriculture industry a more advanced technology makeover, with planning and strategy 
based on real-time information gathering and processing.They produce accurate maps for early soil analysis.</p>
