<p>Drones are very useful for farmers in agriculture. These aerial devices can be used with cameras attached
to them to survey the crops and livestock. They may also be used to help water the plants. Also they can be used to
pick up tools from the tool shed at certain times of the day.</p>

<p> There are cons to this, one of them being that it is not guaranteed that the drone will not get stolen. Secondly 
the drone could get destroyed by the livestock. Lastly the drone could lose the items it is programmed to pick up.</p>

<p> The pros to this are that you'll have more free time to do what you want. You will also save time from walking to 
the tool shed to retrieve your tools.</p>
