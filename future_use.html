<p>Drones will make it easier for us human beings in the future. It can be used to deliver items such as:groceries,
fast food, beauty products,etc. They can also be used to create interesting views for movies or used to survey the 
community instead of having a neighbourhood watch. They could be used as speakers to advertise or broadcast news.</p>

<p>For everything good there is something bad. Meaning that not everyone will like the concept of having drones. Some 
may protest this rapid development in technology; they would try to destroy drones. Certain items needed to build particular drones might be in limited supply 
so the drones themselves might be sold at a higher price. Lastly, the drones can be a danger to animals,meaning they could
harm a bird with its blades. However it could be the case that the bird will attempt to destroy the drone.
